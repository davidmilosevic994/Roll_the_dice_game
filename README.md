# Roll the dice game
Roll the dice browser game
Browser game I have created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Game is for two players where on the beginning of the game players get to choose the countries that they want to represent, and they choose them by writing the name of country in english into the prompt window. After they choose the countries, the countries flags and names are loading in a specific place on screen and I created that using Async/Await and RESTful API (REST Countries). 

Player 1 is the one who starts the game and he is the one who first rolls the dice. Player can roll the dice as many times as he wants and his current score is accumulating, until he rolls the dice with number one and in that moment he loses all his current score, and then it is player’s 2 time to play. For that reason player can save his current score at any moment clicking on the button “Save Score” and that current score in that round of play is adding on all of his previous saved scores. The player who first come to the score 100 and above is the winner of the game. There is the button “New Game” that allows players to start the new game without the need to refresh the page.
